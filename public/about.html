<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I was born in 2002 in Montreal, Canada, but from Brazilian
  and Portuguese origins. I am currently studying at Concordia 
  University in Montreal, where I am pursuing my Bachelor's Degree
  in Computer Science.

  My hobbies include music, gaming, and programming. I listen to 
  all types of music ranging from genres like Punk Rock and Rap, and 
  artists like The Beatles and 100 Gecs. Some of my favourite artists include Kanye
  West, Nirvana, The Smiths, Elliot Smith, and My Chemical Romance. I also love
  to make music in my free time, where I play guitar and make beats. I also love to game
  with my friends. Some of my favourite games include the Pokemon series,
  Grand Theft Auto, and Zelda. Despite having to learn a lot of programming for school, 
  I also love to program during my free time and learn some more.

  I currently live with my girlfriend, Rhemi, and my cat, Ani, in downtown Montreal.
  Fun fact, my cat is named after Anakin from Star Wars, but since she
  is a girl, we call her Ani.
